## How to use this

After deploy the application, use `mysql:3306` to connect to the database. The  password is defined by value of the environment variable `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` defined in the `properties`.

**NOTE: this database example has an emptyDir mounted, this is not recommended in production environments!!**
